Fork this repository to your personal GitHub account and name it:

**your-github-username.github.io**

In the settings of the forked repository, go to "Pages" and under "Build and deployment" make sure to set the "Source" to **Deploy from a branch**. Then, under "Branch" make sure **main** and **/root** are selected, then hit "Save".

Open the new repository in Codespaces, and run `bin/dev` to start the live app preview.

Add an `index.html` file, and put some HTML there. The live preview should load the updates in your browser when you navigate to **/index.html** in the URL bar. Put CSS styles into that `index.html` file directly or into another `my-styles.css` file.

When you are satisfied with the preview, make a commit and push the changes to GitHub. After a few minutes your page will be deployed at:

**https://your-github-username.github.io**
